# Exercise: Building a Simple Layout with Bootstrap 

## Instructions

### 1. Setting Up on CodePen:
   * Start a new pen on CodePen.
   * Incorporate Bootstrap by navigating to 'Settings' > 'CSS' and pasting the Bootstrap CSS CDN link in the 'External Stylesheets' section.

### 2. Structure Your Layout:
   * Begin with a `container` as your primary content wrapper.
   * Within the `container`, establish a `row`.
   * Within the `row`, create three separate columns using the `col` class.

### 3. Content Placement:
   * In the **first column**, incorporate a heading and a paragraph. The topic of this column is "Nature". Ensure the content reflects this theme.
   * In the **second column**, the theme is "Technology". Again, include both a heading and a paragraph that adhere to this subject.
   * For the **third column**, your theme is "Architecture". Craft a heading and paragraph that align with this topic.

### 4. Image Integration:
   * After your text in each column, incorporate an image that represents the theme of that specific column. Use online image sources like Imgur or Unsplash to procure URLs for your images. Remember to utilize Bootstrap's `img-fluid` class to ensure your images adjust appropriately within their respective columns.
